# Matryoshki_Lurie

This is a supplementary material for the paper "Extremely Multistable Matryoshka Systems with
Hidden Attractors" by Artur Karimov, Vyacheslav Rybin, Denis Butusov, Oksana Kuznetsova, Igor Burkin.

Run [Test_initial.m](Test_initial.m) to see the initial twin attractors.

Run [Test_matryoshka.m](Test_matryoshka.m) to see the matryoshka multistable attractors.

Run [Test_matryoshka_a.m](Test_matryoshka_a.m) to see the matryoshka multistable attractors with continuous function.

Run [Test_matryoshka_P.m](Test_matryoshka_P.m) to see the 1D grid of matryoshka multistable attractors.

Run [Test_matryoshka_P_boost.m](Test_matryoshka_P_boost.m) to see the final result: 2D grid of matryoshka multistable attractors.
